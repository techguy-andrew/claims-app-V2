Before proceeding with the main assignment, you must first establish a thorough understanding of the project's foundational requirements and constraints through systematic documentation review.
Execute the following preparatory tasks:

Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the technical foundation:

Thoroughly examine context/documentation/guidelines.md to identify all mandatory technologies, architectural patterns, and technical constraints
Document each specified technology component, version requirement, and integration point
Map all technical dependencies and system boundaries defined in the documentation
Extract non-negotiable technical requirements that will govern implementation decisions

Upon completing this foundational review, synthesize your findings into a structured execution plan that:

Demonstrates complete technical compliance with context/documentation/guidelines.md specifications

Your execution plan must serve as the definitive roadmap for assignment completion, with every decision explicitly justified by reference to the governing documentation.

Your main assignment is as follows:

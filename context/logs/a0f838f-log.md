- **Keyboard navigation** (Enter to save, Escape to cancel)
- **Accessibility compliance** with proper ARIA labels
- **Gap-based spacing** following agency guidelines perfectly

#### 2. **Navigation System** - Battle-Tested Responsive Architecture
- **Simplified architecture** proven through development challenges (commit c630aa0)

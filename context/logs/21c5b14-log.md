# Commit 21c5b14: Documentation Reference Updates

**Date:** 2025-08-30  
**Type:** Fix  
**Scope:** Documentation  
**Impact:** Reference Integrity

## Summary

Corrected all path references following the reorganization of documentation files into the centralized `context/documentation/` directory. This ensures all internal documentation references remain valid and accurate after the structural changes made in commit ffc058e.

## Changes Overview

### Files Modified
- `context/documentation/CLAUDE.md` - Updated path references (2 changes)
- `context/prompts/createplan.md` - Updated guidelines references (2 changes)
- `context/logs/ffc058e-log.md` - Created (143 lines)

### Specific Updates

#### CLAUDE.md Changes
**Line 600:**
- Before: `context/guidelines.md`
- After: `context/documentation/guidelines.md`

**Line 601:**
- Before: `context/development-log.md` 
- After: (Line removed - file doesn't exist)

#### createplan.md Changes
**Line 6:**
- Before: `context/tech-stack.md`
- After: `context/documentation/guidelines.md`

**Line 13:**
- Before: `context/tech-stack.md`
- After: `context/documentation/guidelines.md`

## Technical Implementation

### Reference Mapping
The following reference updates were made to reflect the new documentation structure:

1. **Direct Path Updates:**
   - All references to `context/guidelines.md` → `context/documentation/guidelines.md`
   - References to merged files (`tech-stack.md`) → `context/documentation/guidelines.md`

2. **Removed Invalid References:**
   - `context/development-log.md` - File doesn't exist in repository
   - No replacement needed as this was an outdated reference

3. **Preserved Valid References:**
   - `.env.local` - Remains at root level
   - `components.json` - Remains at root level

### Verification Process
- Searched all documentation files for path references
- Validated each reference against actual file locations
- Confirmed no broken links remain
- Ensured consistency across all documentation

## Development Context

### Rationale
After reorganizing documentation into `context/documentation/` (commit ffc058e), several files still contained outdated path references. This created potential confusion and broken documentation links. This commit fixes all known reference issues.

### Impact Analysis

**Documentation Integrity:**
- All cross-references now resolve correctly
- No broken links in documentation
- Consistent path structure throughout

**Developer Experience:**
- Clear, accurate file references
- No confusion about file locations
- Seamless navigation between documents

**Maintenance Benefits:**
- Single location for all documentation
- Easier to maintain references
- Reduced chance of future broken links

### Related Changes
The `createplan.md` prompt file was also updated to reference the new consolidated `guidelines.md` file instead of the old `tech-stack.md` file that was merged during the consolidation process.

## Quality Assurance

### Reference Validation
```bash
# All references checked and validated:
✓ context/documentation/guidelines.md - File exists
✓ .env.local - Reference preserved (root file)
✓ components.json - Reference preserved (root file)
✗ context/development-log.md - Removed (doesn't exist)
```

### File Integrity
- No content changes beyond reference updates
- All files maintain their original purpose
- Documentation structure remains logical

## Migration Notes

For developers pulling these changes:
```bash
# After pulling
git pull origin main

# Documentation now correctly references:
# - context/documentation/guidelines.md (not context/guidelines.md)
# - No reference to non-existent development-log.md
# - Prompts updated to use new paths
```

## Related Commits

- `ffc058e` - Reorganized documentation into context/documentation/
- `8959921` - Enhanced guidelines with patterns and checklists
- `59d716a` - Consolidated multiple docs into guidelines.md

## Deployment Impact

- **Build Process:** No impact
- **Runtime:** No impact
- **CI/CD:** No impact
- **Documentation only:** Yes

These are documentation-only changes with no effect on application functionality or deployment processes.

- ✅ Invalid references removed
- ✅ No broken links remaining
- ✅ Prompt files updated
- ✅ Documentation consistency maintained
- ✅ Successfully pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Vercel deployment triggered
